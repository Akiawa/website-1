# External Source Repositories
## What is an External Repository?

**Paperback** out of the box only comes with **Paperback** as a source for content. The app however has support for adding content from external repositories which are not on the official listings. 

## Adding an external repository
- Grab the correct repository you want to install
- Copy the link repository and paste it inside the app in your source tab by clicking `Edit` then `+`

## Getting third party repository
Paperback does not hotlink to third party repositories anymore. You must find it yourself.
You can use Google or other means but you can not ask in a support thread where to find it. 
We are not responsible for third party repositories.

## Adding third party sources
__Sources are inside the external repository.__ You need to open the repository in order to install your sources.
We recommend you to get a maximum of 10 third party sources at the same time.
