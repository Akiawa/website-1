### Installation FAQ

#### I am a Patreon supporter.
Refer to our [Patreon installation guide](/help/installation/beta-testflight/#installation)

#### I get "The beta is full" when trying to install the app
There can only be a limited number of testers on TestFlight due to the 10k testers limit enforced by Apple.
To install the app you can use an other method of installation like sideloading with [AltStore](/help/installation/public-altstore/).
